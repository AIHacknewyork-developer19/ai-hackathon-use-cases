# 📧 Document Eligibility Processing Agent

## 📋 Overview

Create an intelligent agent that automatically processes emails to identify eligibility-related documents (income statements, medical records, utility bills, etc.), extracts and processes them using AI-powered OCR, and stores the structured data in a database for eligibility determination. This solution dramatically reduces manual processing time for social services departments.

- Identify and classify different document types (income proof, medical records, utility bills)
- Extract text and structured data using AI-powered OCR and document intelligence
- Validate and normalize extracted data for consistency
- Store processed information in a structured database
- Generate eligibility assessment reports and recommendations
- Maintain audit trails and compliance with privacy regulations

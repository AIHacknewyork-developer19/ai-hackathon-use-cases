Dear NYC Housing Assistance Team,

I am writing to submit the required documentation for my housing assistance application submitted on December 15, 2023 (Application #: HSG-2023-002841).

Current Housing Situation:
I am currently facing difficulties affording my rent due to recent job changes and increased utility costs. I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx and am requesting rental assistance to help maintain stable housing.

Attached Documentation:
1. Most recent utility bill (Con Edison) showing account in good standing
2. Current lease agreement for my apartment 
3. Recent bank statements showing financial hardship
4. Employment verification letter

Financial Details:
- Monthly rent: $1,850
- Monthly income: Variable (part-time employment)
- Monthly utility costs: $350-400 (attached bill shows December amount)
- Other expenses: Food, transportation, medical

I believe I qualify for housing assistance based on the income requirements and my current financial hardship. The utility bill attached shows my current address and demonstrates that I am maintaining the account, though costs have increased significantly.

I am committed to working with your office to maintain my housing stability. Please review my documentation and let me know if additional information is needed.

I appreciate your time and assistance with this matter.

Best regards,

Jennifer Washington

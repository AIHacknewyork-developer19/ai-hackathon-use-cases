Dear Benefits Processing Team,

I am writing to submit my required documentation for my SNAP benefits application (Reference #: SNAP-2024-001567). 

I have attached the following documents as requested:
1. Recent pay stub from my employer (NYC Metro Services Corp)
2. Utility bill showing my current address
3. Medical records documenting my family's healthcare needs

My family situation:
- Household size: 3 (myself, spouse, and one child)
- Monthly income: Approximately $2,475 (net pay from attached paystub)
- Current address: 145-67 Northern Blvd, Apt 2B, Flushing, NY 11354

I believe my family meets the income requirements for SNAP assistance. We are currently struggling with food costs due to reduced work hours at my job. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Please let me know if you need any additional documentation or if there are any issues with the attached files.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Maria Elena Rodriguez
Phone: (347) 555-0123
Application Reference: SNAP-2024-001567

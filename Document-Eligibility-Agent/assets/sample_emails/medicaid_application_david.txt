To Whom It May Concern:

I am submitting this email with attached medical documentation to support my Medicaid application (Application ID: MCD-2023-789456).

Background:
I am currently unable to work due to chronic lower back pain and related mobility issues. My condition has been evaluated by Dr. Sarah Kim at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, and I have been deemed temporarily disabled.

Attached Documents:
1. Complete medical record summary from NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital
2. Physician's disability certification
3. Treatment plan and work restrictions documentation

Financial Situation:
- Current employment status: Temporarily disabled, unable to work
- Monthly income: $0 (no current employment income)
- Medical expenses: Significant ongoing costs for treatment and medications
- Insurance status: Currently uninsured

I am requesting Medicaid coverage to help with my ongoing medical treatment costs, including:
- Regular physician visits for pain management
- Physical therapy sessions (3x weekly)
- Prescription medications for pain and anxiety
- Potential future diagnostic imaging or procedures

My medical provider has indicated that treatment may be needed for 3-6 months, and I meet the income requirements for Medicaid assistance during this period of disability.

Please review the attached medical documentation and let me know if additional information is required for processing my application.

I can be reached at this email address or by phone at (347) 555-7890 if you have any questions.

Thank you for your consideration.

# 🚨 Emergency Response Planning Agent

## 📋 Overview

Develop an agent that helps city departments simulate and plan emergency responses for various scenarios including natural disasters, public health crises, and security incidents. This solution uses multi-agent orchestration to coordinate complex emergency planning tasks.

## 🎯 Challenge Goals

- Simulate emergency scenarios and generate response plans
- Coordinate multi-department response strategies
- Integrate real-time data from weather, traffic, and city systems
- Generate actionable emergency response templates
- Provide decision support during crisis situations
- Optimize resource allocation and deployment

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd Emergency-Response-Agent

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Basic Emergency Response Planning
```python
from src.orchestration.emergency_coordinator import EmergencyResponseCoordinator
from src.models.emergency_models import EmergencyScenario, EmergencyType, SeverityLevel

# Create coordinator
coordinator = EmergencyResponseCoordinator()

# Define emergency scenario
scenario = EmergencyScenario(
    scenario_id="hurricane_maria_2025",
    incident_type=EmergencyType.HURRICANE,
    severity_level=SeverityLevel.SEVERE,
    location="New York City",
    affected_area_radius=25.0,
    estimated_population_affected=2000000,
    duration_hours=72
)

# Generate response plan
response_plan = await coordinator.coordinate_response(scenario)

# Access generated plan components
print(f"Lead Agency: {response_plan.lead_agency}")
print(f"Personnel Required: {response_plan.resource_allocation.personnel_deployment}")
print(f"Estimated Duration: {response_plan.estimated_duration}")
```

### Weather Integration Example
```python
from src.services.weather_service import WeatherService

async with WeatherService() as weather:
    # Get current conditions
    conditions = await weather.get_current_conditions(40.7128, -74.0060)
    
    # Analyze weather impact
    impact = await weather.analyze_weather_impact("hurricane", conditions)

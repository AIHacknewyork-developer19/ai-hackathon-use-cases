# 🤖 AI-Powered Virtual Citizen Assistant

## 📋 Overview

Build an intelligent chatbot that can answer citizen queries about public services such as trash pickup schedules, permit applications, emergency alerts, and more using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## 🎯 Challenge Goals

- Create a conversational AI that understands natural language queries about city services
- Implement RAG to provide accurate, up-to-date information from city databases
- Orchestrate multiple plugins using Semantic Kernel for complex query handling
- Deploy a scalable web application accessible to citizens

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Azure AI Foundry**: AI orchestration and management platform
- **Semantic Kernel**: Plugin orchestration and conversational flow
- **Azure AI Search**: Vector search and document indexing
- **Azure OpenAI**: Large language model for natural language understanding
- **Azure Web App**: Hosting platform for the citizen-facing interface
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Development environment

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Citizen Query → Azure Web App → Semantic Kernel Planner
                                      ↓
                            Plugin Orchestration
                           /        |        \
              Document    /    Scheduling   \    Emergency
              Retrieval  /       APIs        \    Alerts
                        ↓                     ↓        ↓
              Azure AI Search    City APIs    Notification
                                              Service
```

## 💡 Key Features

1. **Natural Language Understanding**: Process citizen queries in plain English
2. **Multi-Service Integration**: Connect to various city service APIs
3. **Real-Time Information**: Provide current schedules, alerts, and status updates
4. **Contextual Responses**: Maintain conversation context for follow-up questions
5. **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully handle queries outside the knowledge base

## 📊 Example Interactions

**User**: "When is my next trash pickup?"  
**Assistant**: "Based on your address, your next trash pickup is scheduled for Thursday, October 3rd. Please have your bins out by 7 AM."

**User**: "How do I apply for a business permit?"  
**Assistant**: "To apply for a business permit, you'll need to submit Form BP-101 along with the required documents. You can apply online at nyc.gov/permits or visit the Business Services office at..."

**User**: "Are there any current emergency alerts in my area?"  
**Assistant**: "There are currently no active emergency alerts for your zip code. For real-time updates, you can also follow @NYCEmergencyMgmt on social media."

## 🚀 Success Metrics

- **Accuracy**: >90% correct responses for supported query types
- **Response Time**: <3 seconds average response time
- **User Satisfaction**: Intuitive conversation flow and helpful responses
- **Coverage**: Handle at least 80% of common citizen service queries
